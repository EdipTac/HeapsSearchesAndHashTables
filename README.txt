The theoretical questions are provided in the .pdf file labelled "Assignment3TheorySolutions.pdf"
This file contains solutions to all of the theoretical questions and has been accurately marked to
indicate what text belongs to which question.

The programming questions are labelled their respective numbers, i.e. the code for question 4 is 
labelled "Question4.java", the code for question 5 is labelled "Question5.java" and so on. 

Additionally, the results files for each question is also added in a .txt file that corresponds to
each question. The names given to these files are the question number along with the Results keyword,
i.e. the results file for question 5 is labelled "Question5Results.txt" and so on.
Please note that all of the programming questions have commented codes available in their .java files
and the workings of each program are described in depth.



Question 5:
The programming portion for question 5 is in the .java file labelled "Question5.java" and contains the
binary search and dictionary search methods used to search the .txt file uploaded on the course website
called "ds17s-asg2-data.txt".
Since the question requires the testing of binary search, the array of names obtained from the .txt file
are sorted using a selection sort algorithm. Since the questions also asks to compare the two methods, 
both of the search methods are tested on the already sorted array to have a fair comparison.
